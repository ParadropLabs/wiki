## WiNGS Lab

The Wisconsin Wireless and NetworkinG Systems (WiNGS) Laboratory was
established at UW-Madison in summer 2005. Research in the WiNGS lab is
conducted in the areas of networking and distributed systems, with a primary
focus on wireless and mobile networking. Research activities in the lab span a
diverse set of activities, ranging from algorithmic design and analysis, and
systems building through functional prototypes. Our projects get deployed in
real and practical scenarios, sometimes in collaboration with partners who
allow us to understand various real constraints, leading in turn to more
refined solutions. The activities of this lab are generously supported at
different times through funding from government agencies (such as the National
Science Foundation) and industrial partners. Dr. Suman Banerjee leads
the WiNGS Lab.
