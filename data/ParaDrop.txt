## ParaDrop

ParaDrop is an open source edge computing platform developed by the WiNGS Lab
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. We built the ParaDrop platform
especially for WiFi routers so that developers can *paradrop* services from the
cloud to the extreme edge of the network, just one hop away from users' mobile
devices, data sources, and actuators of IoT applications. The name ParaDrop
comes from this ability to drop supplies and resources (services) into the far
reaches of the network.
