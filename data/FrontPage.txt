## Wiki

This wiki is an example of a service that can run on ParaDrop. It is installed
like an application on a ParaDrop router and becomes available to users through
the web browser. All of the content is stored locally and privately on the
ParaDrop host device.

## Source Code

The code for this wiki was originally written by James Mills and required
no modification to run on ParaDropâ€”only the addition of a configuration file.
